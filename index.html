          <p>I got interested in making websites when I was surfing the internet. I didn't know much at first, but I'm learning more every day by reading and watching videos online.</p>
          <p>I started learning about HTML and CSS, which are the basic building blocks of websites. I spend a lot of time studying on my own and asking for help when I need it.</p>
          <p>Even though I'm still new to it, I'm already trying to make my own simple websites. Sometimes it's hard, and I make mistakes, but I keep trying because I really want to get better.</p>
        <p>  I like to join workshops and take online classes to learn more. Every time I learn something new, I feel like I'm getting better at making websites.

Now, I'm starting to learn about making web applications, which are more advanced kinds of websites. I'm excited to see what I can create and how much I can learn along the way.  </p>
